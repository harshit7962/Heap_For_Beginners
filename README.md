# Heap_For_Beginners
A heap is a special tree based data structure. More precisely, heap is a complete binary tree.
There are two types of heap:
1) **Min-Heap:** The key present at the root node must be the minimum among the keys present int all of its children.
2) **Max-Heap:** The key present at the root node must be the maximum among the keys present in all of its children.
